# README #

This README would normally document whatever steps are necessary to get your application up and running.

### What is this repository for? ###

* This is the first iPhone app that I wrote back in 2009, teaching myself Objective C and iOS development as I wrote it.
* It's published in the App Store (https://goo.gl/Br0MJl).

### How do I get set up? ###

* To run open the QuickGifter.xcodeproj.
* Originally written for iOS 3 I've done some work eliminating depricated APIs so it will run on iOS 7 and greater.
* There are still some issues on larger screen sizes (iPhone 5, 6, etc.).
